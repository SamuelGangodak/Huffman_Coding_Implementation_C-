Huffman coding, developed by David A. Huffman in 1952, is a widely used algorithm for lossless data compression. It assigns variable-length codes to input characters based on their frequencies, with more frequent characters receiving shorter codes. This efficient coding scheme minimizes the overall bit length of encoded data, making Huffman coding a fundamental technique in various applications, such as file compression and data transmission.
